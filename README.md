###### Background: 
The John's Hopkins Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) epidemiological data is compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) from various sources. <br>
The dataset contains data since 22nd of January 2020. For the data and more information about it, please visit [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases).    
In this lab you will pick up where we left in lecture 2 and analyze the Corona cases and deaths data. 


**Lab 2 - data analyst at the football club- fifa 18 Database**

[README- lab 2](https://github.com/chencnaani/Data-Analysis-with-R/blob/master/README-%20lab%202.md)

###### Background: 
You've been hired as a data analyst at the football (soccer) club Hapoel London. 
Since this is a small and under-funded club, you will not have access to real-football data, but to data from the football computer game fifa18. Your job is to analyze this dataset and extract meaningful insights from the data in order 
to help your club make better decisions. 


**My favorite project is Lab 2 - because the work on it was interesting as well as using complex visualization to get insights easily.**
